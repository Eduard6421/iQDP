1. [Link to original implementation by Revaud et al.](https://github.com/naver/deep-image-retrieval);
2. Fork of Revaud et al.'s repository containing modifications to their work (saving image embeddings for queries and database images, saving the top 100 results)
3. Instructions in order to run the retrieval methods and obtain the average precision of each query.
One more thanks to the original authors for making their work public!
